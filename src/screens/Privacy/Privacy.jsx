                            differ in certain locations based on local law, in which case CypherCrescent will comply with the

                        <p>Personal data is any information that allows an individual to be identified directly or indirectly (e.g.,

                        <p>Sensitive personal data is that which, in cases of misuse, may cause unlawful or arbitrary
                            discrimination or other serious risks to a data subject (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, nationality,
                            political opinion, religious and philosophical beliefs, and physical or mental health conditions).
                            Personal data and sensitive personal data are collectively referred to as "personal information."</p>

                        <h4>Collecting and Processing Personal Information</h4>
                        <p>CypherCrescent collects and processes personal information that is necessary for legitimate
                            business purposes, which will be disclosed to the data subject at the time of collection.
                            CypherCrescent will use and process this information only for the purposes for which it was
                            collected, retaining the personal information only for so long as is required for the specific purpose
                            for which the information was collected.</p>
                        <p>CypherCrescent will not collect sensitive personal data except when permitted or required to do so
                            by law and will do so only for legitimate business purposes. If in any other instance a need arises to
                            collect sensitive personal data, CypherCrescent will do so only with the data subject's express
                            consent, which can be withdrawn at any time.</p>
                        <p>CypherCrescent will not sell, disclose or rent personal information for direct marketing purposes</p>
                        <h4>Transfer of Personal Information</h4>
                        <p>CypherCrescent may transfer the personal information outside the data subject's home country
                            when: (i) it has the consent of the data subject; (ii) it is necessary or appropriate as permitted by
                            law to do so because it is relevant to CypherCrescent's dealings with the data subject; or (iii) it is
                            required by law. CypherCrescent will implement reasonable measures to protect the security and
                            confidentiality of personal information and provide an adequate level of protection in each of the
                            locations where the information is transferred.</p>
                        <h4>Onward Transfer</h4>
                        <p>In limited circumstances, CypherCrescent may disclose personal information to a third party who is
                            providing a service to CypherCrescent. CypherCrescent will only disclose personal information if
                            the third party has provided satisfactory assurances to CypherCrescent of its ability to provide
                            appropriate and sufficient data privacy and security safeguards to protect the personal information
                            from unauthorised disclosure, use or loss. Where CypherCrescent learns that a third party is using
                            or disclosing personal information in a manner contrary to this policy, CypherCrescent will take
                            reasonable steps to discontinue such use or disclosure.</p>
                        <p>
                            Disclosures to third parties will be only for the purposes described in this policy, for a compatible
                            purpose, or for a purpose authorised by the data subject.</p>
                        <h4>Choice and Options</h4>
                        <p>CypherCrescent gives data subjects the opportunity to choose not to have his or her personal
                            information transferred to third parties for use in a manner incompatible with the purpose for
                            which it was originally collected. An employee may not opt out of the transfer of his or her personal
                            information to a third party if it is being conducted for the purpose of: (1) meeting applicable legal
                            requirements, or (2) furthering the legitimate employment relationship with CypherCrescent. Prior
                            to transferring sensitive personal data for use in a manner incompatible with the purpose for which
                            it was originally collected, an explicit (opt-in) choice will be sought.</p>
                        <h4>Security of Personal Information</h4>
                        <p>Only authorized colleagues with a valid, work-related need may access a data subject's personal
                            information. In the event of a data breach, CypherCrescent will issue breach notifications as may be
                            required under applicable law.</p>
                        <h4>Data Subject Rights</h4>
                        <p>While personal information is maintained by CypherCrescent, a data subject may access the

                            of identity before providing access to personal information.</p>
                        <h4>Responsibility</h4>
                        <p>If a data subject has a question about this policy or a complaint about the way CypherCrescent has

                                    another site does not mean that CypherCrescent endorses the content or use of such site or its

                                    enter into with third parties, even if you learn of such parties (or use a link to such parties) from
                                    our site. Accordingly, you acknowledge and agree that CypherCrescent is not responsible for the

                                    take precautions to protect yourself from viruses, worms, trojan horses, and other potentially
                                    destructive programs, and to protect your information as you deem appropriate.</p>

                                <p> If any provision of this agreement is found invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, then that
                                    provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches
                                    the intent of the original provision, and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect.</p>
